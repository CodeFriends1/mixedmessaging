# Mixed Messaging Project

This project is based on the Mixed Messaging project prompt on Codecademy. A few webpages are scraped using npm, axios, cheerio, and fs-node. The webscraped data consists of quotes from two different sources and a large list of adjectives to be used to substitute words existing in the quotes as they were retrieved.

Updated quotes are combined together into one output.
